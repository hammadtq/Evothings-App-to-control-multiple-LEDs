# Arduino 2 LED On/Off using Bluetooth HC-05

This example shows how to communicate with an Arduino board
using a HC-05 Bluetooth module. This further expands on how we can 
control 2 LEDs using jQueryMobile tabs and pages.

For corresponding sketch, run arduino2ledbluetooth.ino on the Arduino.

This is to go with my tutorial: <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Developing-Mobile-App-to-Control-Lights-of-Two-Roo/">Developing an app to control Lights of 2 Rooms</a>
